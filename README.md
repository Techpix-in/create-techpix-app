# Create Techpix App

The easiest way to get started with Techpix projects is by using create-techpix-app. This CLI tool enables you to quickly scaffold a new application by cloning one of the pre-configured boilerplates from a curated list of templates designed to follow Techpix's code conventions and project architecture.

### Interactive

You can create a new project interactively by running:

```bash
npx create-techpix-app
# or
yarn create techpix-app
# or
pnpm create techpix-app
```
