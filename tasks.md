### Risk Mitigation

1. **Template Complexity**: Start with simple templates, iterate to add complexity
2. **Package Manager Variations**: Implement npm first, add yarn/pnpm support later
3. **Cross-platform Issues**: Test early on Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Dependency Conflicts**: Pin versions and test combinations thoroughly
5. **User Experience**: Conduct user testing with real developers throughout development
